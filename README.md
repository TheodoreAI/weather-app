## Dev Progress

### Day 1

### What I did -

- [x] Making the weather app view is done
- [x] Download and add Axios to make the API Calls
- [x] Make sure API keys are stored in an untracked/uncommitted .env file

### Any Issues -

- [ ] ~~Insight Weather API is out of service~~ have to use Mars Curiosity CSV data

### What I learned -

- You have to start .env variables with `VUE_APP_` in Vue
- axios `get` -> `then` -> `catch`

### Day 2

### What I did -

- [x] **Make the weather app sol components is currently in progress**
- [x] There are other APIs, so continue with the Mars Image API to add images to the weather sol cards
- [x] Use Bootstrap to style the Navbar
- [ ] Build the Detail View for the cards
- [ ] Add images to the detail view and the cards

### Any Issues -

- [ ] ~~Not all sols have images~~

### What I learned -

- Using the Rover Photos API to pull different types of images from different instruments

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
